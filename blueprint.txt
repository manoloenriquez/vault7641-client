Vault 7641 Website Outline v1
Objective: Drive WL claims, Discord joins, and mint CTR while establishing trust, clarity,
and smooth wallet UX for Solana (Candy Machine + Sugar). Mobile-first; handles ~20k
concurrent visitors.
A. Information Architecture & Routes (mint day)
Primary (one-page) with anchor sections, plus a few light subpages for legal/support.
Routes:
• / (Mint Landing — canonical)
• /mint (alias → same page, scroll to Mint widget)
• /claim (post-mint: guild select + PFP claim)
• /guilds (light overview; optional modal on landing)
• /faq (can be an accordion on landing + separate path for SEO)
• /status (mint status JSON + human page for incidents)
• /terms, /privacy, /disclaimer (legal)
• /support (troubleshooting + wallet guides)
Minimize nav friction on mint day: header CTAs always include Connect Wallet, WL Claim,
Join Discord.
B. Page-Level Wireframe (above-the-fold → footer)
1. Hero (two states)
o Countdown State (when date set): H1 (value-proof + urgency), subhead
(what you unlock), countdown, CTAs: Get Priority Access (WL) /Get Your Pass
(Mint)
o Coming Soon State (no date yet): H1 + Discord CTA,
2. Mint Module (sticky card)
o Shows current phase (WL/Public/Paused/Sold Out), supply bar, price,
per-wallet cap, network status; buttons: Mint 1, +/–, Max.
o States: not connected / connecting / wrong network / not eligible (WL) / cap
reached / tx pending / success (confetti) / fail (error code + retry) / sold out.
o Edge UX: auto-retry on RPC 429; fee payer fallback; pre-flight sim + exact fee
preview.
3. How It Works (3-step)
o Step 1: Mint your Base Pass
o Step 2: Choose your Guild (72h window recommended) & claim PFP
o Step 3: Verify in Discord → start quests & rank up (XP).
o Inline micro-FAQ links.
4. The Guilds (carousel or 5-card grid)
o Trader/HODLers, DeFi & Airdrops, NFTs & Gaming, Developer, Careers.
o Each card: short “who it’s for”, 3 perks, sample PFP tile, View more (opens
/guilds or modal).
5. Member Benefits (value-proof)
o Immediate access to the vault, raffles, progression/leaderboards, Inter-Guild
Cup.
o Small, honest copy: “Membership collectible. Not an investment.”
6. Roadmap / Season Model
o Season length, renewal concept, etc.
7. Social Proof
o KOL/partner logo strip, credentials, “as seen on” PR slots.
8. FAQ
o Mint mechanics, wallets, guild lock/claim, support, refunds policy (none),
terms of use.
9. Footer (Compliance-first)
o Disclaimers link, terms/privacy, contact, social links.
C. Component Specs & Microcopy
• Hero H1 options (choose 1 to A/B later):
1. Your crypto homebase. One pass. Real value.
2. Get Entry Access. Join a guild. Survive & Thrive Together.
3. No hype. Just skills, tools, and opportunities.
• Subhead: A curated Web3 community with unlimited education, opportunities, and
fun perks.
• Primary CTAs: Connect Wallet, Claim WL, Join Discord.
• Mint Card Copy:
o Title: Base Pass — S1 (Supply: 7,641).
o Phase pill: Priority Access / OGs / Public / Sold out.
• How-it-works bullets: Mint → Choose guild → Claim PFP → Verify.
D. States & Logic (happy & failure paths)
• Eligibility: WL list; else Public.
• Caps: parameterized (e.g., WL 2 / Public 1 per tx) — surfaced in UI + disabled
controls when reached.
• Anti-bot: edge rate limits, human challenge on suspicious velocity,
• RPC hygiene: preconnect, fallback providers, exponential backoff.
E. Post-Mint Claim Flow (/claim)
1. Connect wallet → detect Base Pass.
2. Choose Guild (finalize within 72h recommended), confirm choice.
3. Receive PFP
4. Update metadata
5. View Profile (shows guild badge, XP seed).
F. Navigation & Header Behavior
• Sticky header with scroll-shrink;
• Left: logo; Center: hash links (How it works, Guilds, FAQ); Right: Claim WL, Join
Discord, Connect Wallet (stateful avatar when connected).
• Mobile: menu drawer + persistent Mint button.
G. Visual System (mint day)
• Style: “Vault-tech” modern—dark neutral base with a bold accent per guild;
rounded-2xl cards; soft shadows; neon micro-accents only on key CTAs.
• Hero: subtle animated grid; no heavy video.
• PFP tiles: show Common/Uncommon/Rare/Legendary shells.
H. Performance & Reliability
• SSR for mint module only; rest SSG.

I. Anti-Bot & Abuse Controls
• WL Merkle validation at edge; signed payloads for mints.
• Per-IP velocity caps; device fingerprint to cool down abusers; manual pause switch.
• Obscure Candy Machine IDs client-side; rotate endpoints when under attack.
J. Analytics (focus KPIs)
• Events: wl_claim_success, join_discord_click, join_discord_success (if deep link
returns), mint_card_view, mint_click, mint_success, mint_fail, faq_open,
support_open.
• Dashboards: Real-time funnel (Landing → WL claim → Wallet connect → Mint start →
Success); cohort of Discord joiners; RPC error heatmap.
• Stack: GA4 + Plausible (privacy) + Mixpanel (product events) with consent gating.
K. Content Blocks (copy skeletons)
• Guilds (5): one-liner “who it’s for” + 3 perks; include sample weekly activity list.
• Benefits: access in 48h to gated channels, weekly calendar, quests/XP; partner
perks; raffles; leaderboards/Inter-Guild Cup.
