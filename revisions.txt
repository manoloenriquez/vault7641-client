Pre-Mint Website
What to ADD, CHANGE, REDUCE
Add (P0 = must have before WL opens)
1. Guilds in Preview Mode web section (5 cards + 5 lightweight /guild-preview pages)
Each card = “Who this is for” + Free Benefits) + “ List of Benefits Holders unlock
after mint.”
2. Safety-First ribbon (fixed top): “Staff never DM first • Official links • Report scam” →
links to /safety.
3. WL Meter + Deadlines block (homepage + /how-to-wl)
Live % filled, “last 24h WL added,” and the next cutoff; matches the Discord nightly
post.
4. Event strip (PH time) with one-click “Set Reminder” (Twitter/YouTube/Calendar) +
Discord Stage link.
5. /status (human page + JSON feed) for incidents + banner hook on mint day. (You
already scoped this—surface earlier, not just mint day.)
6. /safety (pre-mint) with verified official links + report form; show last 3 takedowns
(from Discord #scam-alerts).
Change (P0/P1)
1. Home above-the-fold: Replace generic hero with a claim-forward layout
(countdown + two primary CTAs only: Claim Access Pass and Join Discord; “Mint”
CTA stays but demoted until further notice).
2. How-it-Works: Explicit 3-step flow with micro-FAQ (Mint Access Pass → Choose
Guild (+72h to finalize) → Verify in Discord → Start Learning & Earning). You outlined
this flow—promote it higher and add Discord deep links.
3. Guild grid: Rename to match the refined audiences: Builder / Trader / Gamer /
Farmer / Pathfinder and surface a preview quest link on each card.
4. Legal copy: Elevate “membership collectible / not an investment” line near the hero
and Mint module, not just footer. (You already noted the stance—make it
prominent.)
5. Header CTAs: Keep Join Discord, Claim WL, Connect Wallet sticky; hide low-
intent items behind a “More” menu during pre-mint to reduce clicks lost.
Reduce (P1)
1. Deep subpages pre-mint: Keep to Home, /how-to-wl (or /faq), /guild-preview/*,
/safety, /press, /status, /terms/privacy/disclaimer. Push everything else into
scannable sections.

• Try it now: Founding Quests
• Open Class (watch-only): next date/time (PH) + RSVP.
• Holders unlock: (List of benefits)
• CTA: Join Discord • Claim WL • See tonight’s event.
/safety
• Official links, anti-phishing checklist, last 3 takedowns (auto-pull headlines from Discord digest),
report form.
/mint (alias to Mint card anchor on Home)
• Visible but “soft” until T-3. On T-3, elevate card and show Count-down + eligibility states (WL/Public)
with precise error states and retries. (Keep your RPC hygiene & fallback design.)
/status
• Human page (incident timeline + workarounds) + JSON feed. Hook a site-wide banner that appears
on non-200 JSON states.
Analytics & tracking (implement now)
Core events (Mixpanel/GA4/Plausible—consent-gated):
• wl_claim_start, wl_claim_success
• discord_click, discord_join_confirmed (use deep-link pingback)
• quest_click, event_rsvp_click (from site to Discord)
• mint_card_view, mint_click, mint_success, mint_fail
• faq_open, safety_open, status_open
Properties: source (UTM), guild_interest (from clicked card), device, region, language.
Dashboards: Landing → WL → Discord → Quest start → RSVP → Mint funnel; RPC error heatmap; mobile CWV.
(Matches your blueprint; keep budgets: JS ≤170KBgz, CSS ≤60KB, LCP <1.9s 4G).
Deep-link map to Discord (critical)
• Join Discord → #start-here
• How WL works → #how-to-wl pin
• Today’s Quest → #daily-quests message ID
• Taster Quests → per-guild #*-preview pinned thread
• RSVP → the Event object link (Discord Stage)
• Support → #open-a-ticket button
Use UTMs on every link so you can attribute by page/section.
Performance, reliability, security (non-negotiables)
• Keep the mint module SSR and everything else SSG; strict perf budgets as in your outline; Cloudflare
in front; incident banner from /status.
• Anti-bot: WL Merkle at edge, rate caps, human challenge on velocity spikes, canary mint, pause
switch—already in your spec; ensure it’s wired before T-3.
• Legal: Disclaimer above fold near Mint card; Terms/Privacy/Cookie; PH-aware notes.
